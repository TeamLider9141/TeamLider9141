### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My first repository in GitHub
I'm Ortiq from Uzbekistan, and I do content on  Dot-Net(C#) and Development. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Csharp and
C++, as well as work in Visual Studio. I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux, and design in general. You can check out my URL at
